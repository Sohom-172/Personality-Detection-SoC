# Week-1
In this week we will primarily focus on learning the libraries that we are gonna use in our coding a lot.

The libraries are :
1. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) : used for working majorly with arrays, working in domain of linear algebra, matrices
2. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) : powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis
3. [Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/) : as the name suggests it's used for scientific and technical computing

This week is mainly focussed on learning/brushing up your concepts on the "super useful libraries".

For understanding the concepts more these videos can be useful.
