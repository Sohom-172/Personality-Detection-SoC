# Week-4
In this week we will be learning what is neural networks?

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVeqrPGfuCY&list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN&index=46) is quite informative about what exactly is neural networks.

[This](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/cloud/learn/neural-networks) is a very brief but efficient reading resource for what exactly is neural networks.
Examples of how to use the neural networks is provided in the jupyter notebook.

Personally I found these 2 videos very descriptive and informative:

*[How does Neural Networks learn?](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk)
